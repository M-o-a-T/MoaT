Utilities for Python
====================

This is a Python "util" submodule with code that I habitually use in so
many projects that I decided to split it off into its own git archive.

This code is not a Python module. The idea is to add it as a submodule to
your Python code::

   git submodule add git@github.com:smurfix/util-py.git src/your_module/util 

and then relative-import::

   from .util import attrdict

Feel free to extend and embrace. Patches welcome.
