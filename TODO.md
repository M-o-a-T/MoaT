* test console data
  * write an app for it
* the single-channel listener+connect apps must be converted to streams
  * so that we can put a Reliable above them
* BaseCmdMsg dispatcher: multiplex remote iterators locally
* more flex build of stream structure?
* security, esp. for specific subtrees / apps
* test for iterators
* test for remote cancellation
* test for reconnecting
* implement start/stop/restart of subsystems more cleanly
* teach a subdispatcher to refresh themselves if their destination
  terminates / restarts

* link path. Right now an app doesn't know where it itself is.
  Does it need to?

* docstrings for commands?

* implement (and test) all the fancy pin and relay features

* NamedSerial should open a device if running on Unix-ÂµPy
