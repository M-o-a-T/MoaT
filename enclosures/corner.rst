Corner box
==========

This is an OpenSCAD model of a three-sided pyramid. Three faces are
rectangular to each other, the fourth can be clipped on top.

This is an enclosure and designed to occupy the corner of a room. The three
edges may be sized independently, though for esthetics a symmetric approach
should be taken.

Besides sizing and wall thinkness, you can parametrize the number and
placement of mounting holes and how much to cut off the edges so that the
box will fit into a corner whose edges aren't quite sharp. The hooks which
connect the sides to each other have a couple of parameters; the ridges
which the hooks hold onto are auto-generated accordingly.

There's no parameter for a inserting a cable, openings for sensors, or
attachments to mount a PCB, though these can be added easily. Each
side has identical standardized geometry.
