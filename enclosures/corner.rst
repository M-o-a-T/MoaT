Corner box
==========

This is an OpenSCAD model of a three-sided pyramid. Three faces are
rectangular to each other, the fourth can be clipped on top.

The model works as an enclosure, designed to occupy the corner of a room.
The three edges may be sized independently, though for esthetics a
symmetric approach is preferable (i.e. the two horizontal dimensions should
be equal).

Besides sizing and wall thinkness, you can parametrize the number and
placement of mounting holes. You can also change how much to cut off the
edges, so that the box will fit into a corner whose edges are somewhat
rounded. The hooks that connect the sides to each other have a couple of
parameters; the ridges which the hooks hold onto are auto-generated
accordingly.

The box is designed to self-lock. However, as PLA is somewhat brittle,
each corner can be secured by a screw.

There's no parameter for a inserting a cable, openings for sensors, or
attachments to mount a PCB; these can be added easily.

The prints have been tested with PLA and PETG. If you want to paint the
lid, print it with PLA and use the screws to hold it; otherwise printing
the lid with PETG and using the hooks works.
